## Week 2

**Goals:** Create converter tool using test-driven development

**Activity:** Began by trying to add lines in characters together
as large polylines, like a maze-solver, but switched to bulk-adding all lines,
connecting only horizontal lines together, and drawing many individual lines.

Did lots of testing of the software to refine it.

Was not made with test-driven development, as the results were mostly visual.

**Important Docs, Commits, or Code Reviews**: nopolylines

**Things learned:** There are many ways to solve problems, and
you should not think the one you pick first is sacred.
The library used to draw and save the images does
not show the finished image at the same time if it saves the image.
