# Froscii Reflection


## Design

* How closely did you follow your design document after the review was complete?
Did your implementation need to change based on what you learned once you were
underway? 

I missed a lot of what I wanted to do. A lot, but I still ended up making something useful.
I learned that I am a terrible student, and that I take more than I can handle because I didn't
know what even the professors at Bloomtech didn't know.

## Project

* How did you handle the ambiguity of defining your own project and user
  stories? What strategies did you use to decide on concrete work to do to
  satisfy your requirements?
User stories were easy to come up with, as I was making this with myself in mind.
* How did you deal with getting stuck on a problem? What strategies did you
  employ to get yourself unblocked?
I seeked outside help of all kinds, ranging from countless 1:1 meetings, lots of visits to
stackoverflow, and even asking Chat GPT questions
* Did any of your commitments you made in your team charter help navigate a
  difficult decision, situation, or collaboration challenge? How?
No, because of course I did everything, because no one else uses this program.

## Scrum

* What did you find to be the most valuable part of daily stand-ups? Is there
  anything you would want to do differently at stand-up to make it more useful
  to you?
These helped me evaluate what was actually out of scope and not feasible to add.
* Did you over or underestimate the work you could complete during your sprints?
  What have you learned that will help you better estimate work next time?
I hugely underestimated what I could do. It was all so enfuriating. Next time I will
not do something that my teachers don't even know how to do. Big load of help, they were.

## Looking ahead

* If you were to start this unit over again, what would you do differently? How
  do you see yourself applying that to your work in later units, the capstone,
  or your internship?
I would make an extremely simple project, like a high score uploader. This was a hugely massive
waste of my time. I now know how to navigate DDB and S3 and API and Lambda, so I'll use those 
skills there.
